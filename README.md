# CipherX
CipherX is a text encryption and decryption system designed to convert plaintext into cipher text using encoding techniques like Caesar Cipher, Base64, AES, and RSA. It enables users to secure messages, apply cryptographic methods for data protection, and decode them when needed. With a user-friendly interface and real-time Processing.

### **Project Title: CipherX**  
**Brief Description:**  
CipherX is a text encoding and decoding system designed to convert plaintext into secure cipher text and decrypt it back into readable format. This project explores classical and modern encryption techniques, ensuring secure communication by transforming messages into encoded formats using various cipher methods.  

The project will implement **symmetric** and **asymmetric** encryption techniques, including **Base64 Encoding** depending on the security requirements. Users can input a message, choose an encoding method, and retrieve the encrypted text. Likewise, the system provides a decryption function to recover the original message.  

### **Key Features:**  
âœ” **Multiple Encryption Algorithms** â€“ Supports classical and modern ciphers.  
âœ” **User-Friendly Interface** â€“ Simple UI/CLI for encoding and decoding text.
